    /** 
        The basic event class. It models an event in the
        simulator: contains all the basic methods for handling an
        event.

        To define a new "type" of events in your system model, you
        need to derive a class from this, overriding the virtual
        doit() method.

        This class also inclides a static qevent queue, where all
        "active" events are enqueued. To insert an event in the
        queue, you can call the post() method specyfing a
        triggering time. Events are ordered in the queue by
        triggering time. In case of two events with the same
        triggering time, events are ordered by priority. In fact,
        it is also possible to specify a priority for every event
        object. The priority is for the object, and not for the
        class!

        When an event is "triggered" in the simulation, its doit()
        method is invoked. In most of the cases, the doit() method
        simply calls a method of an entity, which will be
        informally called "handler" of the event.

        In case the doit() method \b only calls the appropriate
        event handler, you can use the template class GEvent<X>
        instead of deriving a new class.

        An event can have a list of statistical objects. These are
        objects that are used to collect statistics on the
        system. See BaseStat for more details.

        Finally, and event has a list of tracing objects. These
        are used to trace the evolution of the system for
        analysing it later. See Trace class for more details.
